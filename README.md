## ‚ú® What Makes Puch Home Different?

### ‚ö° Instant, Flexible Smart Home Control
- Tired of waiting for apps to load just to turn off a light or fan?  
- Puch Home lets you send a single message (from WhatsApp) to control devices instantly.  
- No lag. No app installs. No limits.

### üß† Powered by MCP + Puch AI
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** safely connects your AI to real-world devices and tools.
- **Puch AI integration** means you can use natural language‚Äîno technical jargon needed.

### üåç Vendor-Agnostic, Always Growing
- One interface for all your smart devices (multi-vendor support coming soon).
- Turn your phone into a portable Alexa‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre not home.

## üö® Real-Time Security Camera Integration (MVP Feature)

Puch Home includes a real-time snapshot feature using ONVIF and a security camera.  
- Get a live image from a security cam sent straight to your phone.
- **Note:** This is an MVP feature‚Äîcurrently only a pre-configured security camera is supported (due to hackathon time constraints).  
- **Future Scope:** Full support for adding/removing your own devices is planned. For now, you get a taste of real-world integration beyond just mock/demo data!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Demo Data Notice

> **Note:**  
> The current version of Puch Home works with _demo data for most device actions_.  
> Device toggling is simulated for demonstration, **except for the real security camera snapshot (ONVIF)**.
>
> **Future Scope:**  
> The architecture is being built for true remote control, automation, and multi-device management‚Äîall from one tool.  
> Stay tuned as real device logic and multi-vendor APIs are added!

## üí° Why This Project?

> This started as a personal hackathon project to solve a real pain:  
> "Why should I wait for an app to load just to turn something on or off?"  
> With Puch Home, your AI listens and acts, no matter where you are.  
> It‚Äôs your voice-powered remote for the whole smart world!

## How to Install and Run the Project

This project is built to run on your local machine, and was developed during a hackathon.

To run it yourself:
- Clone the repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/aursalan/puch-home.git`
- Create and activate a virtual environment:  
  `uv venv`  
  `uv sync`  
  `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Configure the `.env` file for authentication and device settings:  
  `cp .env.example .env`  
  *Edit* `AUTH_TOKEN`, `MY_NUMBER`, camera variables in `.env`
- Start the MCP server:  
  `cd mcp-bearer-token`  
  `python mcp_starter.py`
- (Optional) Expose your server publicly with ngrok:  
  `ngrok http 8086`

**No additional setup is required for basic functionality if dependencies are installed.**

## How to Use the Project

Once the server is running:
- Connect with Puch AI via WhatsApp using the provided `/mcp connect` command.
- Control your smart home devices and request security camera snapshots in natural language.
- Demo data is used for most device actions; real camera snapshots require ONVIF configuration in `.env`.
