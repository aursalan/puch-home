## How to Install and Run the Project

This project is built to run on your local machine, and was developed during a hackathon.

To run it yourself:
- Clone the repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/aursalan/puch-home.git`
- Create and activate a virtual environment:  
  `uv venv`  
  `uv sync`  
  `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Configure the `.env` file for authentication and device settings:  
  `cp .env.example .env`  
  *Edit* `AUTH_TOKEN`, `MY_NUMBER`, camera variables in `.env`
- Start the MCP server:  
  `cd mcp-bearer-token`  
  `python mcp_starter.py`
- (Optional) Expose your server publicly with ngrok:  
  `ngrok http 8086`

**No additional setup is required for basic functionality if dependencies are installed.**

## How to Use the Project

Once the server is running:
- Connect with Puch AI via WhatsApp using the provided `/mcp connect` command.
- Control your smart home devices and request security camera snapshots in natural language.
- Demo data is used for most device actions; real camera snapshots require ONVIF configuration in `.env`.
